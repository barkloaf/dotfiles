# picom opacity rules
#
# format as you would in picom.conf but with whitespace-delimited strings
# (with quotation marks) instead of comma-delimited ones as per bash array syntax
# 
# ex:
# opacity_rule=(
#    "100:class_g = 'flameshot'"
#    "100:class_g = 'foobar' && !focused"
# )

opacity_rule=(
